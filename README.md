## Introduction

This is a copy of the code written by [Samantha Geitz](https://twitter.com/samanthageitz) at Laracon 2018 during her talk ["Jest Do it."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxlqFgY0BGY).

It is a basic Vue/Laravel application with some tests written in [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Vue-Test-Utils](https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/) written to test front-end functionality.

Currently, this project is using an in-development version of [Laravel Jest Presets](https://github.com/tightenco/laravel-preset-jest/). This package is *NOT ON PACKAGIST AND PROBABLY NOT PRODUCTION READY*, but you can use it if you are interested in trying out Jest easily in your Laravel applications! 

*COMING SOON - A REACT VERSION OF THIS PROJECT!*
